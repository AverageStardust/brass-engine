# Brass Engine #
Make games with the flexibility of p5.js, the power of Matter.js, and the speed of REGL.
___
**Brass is still in alpha, the API will break often.** <br>
Brass is flexible, you can write p5 style code or lean into the engine's power.
After running ```Brass.init()``` everything is in one easy namespace.
Brass engine loads from one easy file, it requires p5.js; Brass can optionally pull in other libraries.
Either way you have tools like tilemap, lighting and input systems.

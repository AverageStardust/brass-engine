# Brass Engine

Make games with the flexibility of p5.js, the power of Matter.js, and the speed
of REGL.

---

**Brass is still in alpha, the API will break often.** <br> Brass is flexible,
you can write p5 style code or lean into the engine's power. After running
`Brass.init()` everything is in one easy namespace. Brass engine loads from one
easy file, it requires p5.js; Brass can optionally pull in other libraries.
Either way you have tools like tilemap, lighting and input systems.

## [Docs](https://wdsteve.github.io/brass-engine/docs)
**All public classes and functions are found in the Brass namespace during runtime.**

## Future ideas, no promises!
### 0.16.0
directional light
start TypeDoc docs

### 0.17.0
UI/mouse input system

### 0.18.0
regl drawn tilemaps

### Maybe?
extended Matter.js support
extended p5.js WEBGL support
JSON/text/binary/model loading
inventory ui
save state system
animation loading/handling

### Will probably never happen
post-processing system
raytraced lighting with REGL
behaviour trees

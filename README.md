# Brass Engine

Make games with the flexibility of p5.js, the features of Matter.js, and the speed
of WEBGL.
___
**Brass is no longer maintained** <br> 
Write p5 style code with the power of a game engine. After running
`Brass.init()` everything is in one easy namespace. Brass engine loads from one
easy file, it requires p5.js; Brass can optionally pull in other libraries.
Either way you have tools like tilemap, lighting and input systems.

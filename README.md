# Brass Engine

Make games with the flexibility of p5.js, the features of Matter.js, and the speed
of WEBGL.
___
**Brass is still in alpha, the API will break often.** <br> 
Write p5 style code with the power of a game engine. After running
`Brass.init()` everything is in one easy namespace. Brass engine loads from one
easy file, it requires p5.js; Brass can optionally pull in other libraries.
Either way you have tools like tilemap, lighting and input systems.

## Future ideas, no promises!
### 0.17.0
* UI/mouse input system
### 0.18.0
* regl drawn tilemaps
### Maybe?
* extended Matter.js support
* extended p5.js WEBGL support
* JSON/text/binary/model loading
* inventory ui
* save state system
* animation loading/handling
### Will probably never happen
* post-processing system
* raytraced lighting with WEBGL2
* behaviour trees
* p5 asset / ui editor / in-game level editor
* multiplayer support
